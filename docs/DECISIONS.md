# Decisions

Settled decisions, newest first. A decision here is not reopened without a
reason recorded as a new entry. Each says what was decided, when, and why —
the why matters more than the what, because it is what tells a later session
whether changed circumstances actually undermine the decision.

## 2026-09-10 — The database is the product; sources are candidates

Nothing is written as fact by any process. Every source produces a candidate
that is checked before admission, whatever the source. Automation, when it
comes, proposes rather than writes.

**Why:** previous attempts let extraction write directly, so an unbounded
residue of edge cases sat on the critical path. Under a gateway, partial
automation is still useful and failed automation costs nothing.

## 2026-09-10 — First slice: outcome by bill type, and time per stage

Across all sessions. Nothing else — no member in charge, party, votes or text.

**Why:** the minimum most users want, buildable by hand in about a day, and
therefore usable as the reference dataset that later automation must reproduce.

## 2026-09-10 — Hand-build before automation

The first slice is entered by hand. Automation is attempted afterwards and is
accepted only if it reproduces the hand-built values.

**Why:** the failure mode is chain length — variable to source to assessment to
edge cases to gaps to reconciliation, with no checkpoint. Hand-building produces
both a ground truth and a written list of the real edge cases, which converts an
open-ended judgement problem into a pass/fail one.

## 2026-09-10 — PostgreSQL on the VPS, reached over SSH

Data lives on the VPS from the start, not locally. Postgres 17 listens on
loopback only; clients tunnel in over SSH.

**Why:** starting on the server avoids a migration later and means there is one
copy of the truth. Loopback plus tunnel keeps port 5432 off the public internet
and leaves the existing firewall untouched.

## 2026-09-10 — SSH forwarding relaxed, pinned to the database port

`AllowTcpForwarding local` with `PermitOpen 127.0.0.1:5432`, replacing
`AllowTcpForwarding no`. Original config kept as `.pre-db-tunnel.bak`.

**Why:** DBeaver needs a tunnel, and the alternative — exposing 5432 through the
firewall — means a public database, TLS to configure, and a rule that breaks
whenever the client IP changes. `PermitOpen` means the relaxation reaches
Postgres on loopback and nothing else.
